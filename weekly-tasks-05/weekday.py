# Weekly Task 05 - Part of coursework for ATU 24-25: 4122 -- PROGRAMMING AND SCRIPTING
# Author Linda Nikolajeva

# Programme that that outputs whether or not today is a weekday
# Per guidelines there is no user input
# In addition, it is not required to list what day of the week it is
# Only if it is a weekday or the weekend

from datetime import date
# datetime is a module built into python, it allows me (us) to work with dates and times
# however, it must be imported 
# as python comes with many built in modules, but they are not automatically loaded into my programme
# supposedly this keeps python efficient, so only the necessary code is loaded
# importing just the date part makes sure I  donâ€™t import unnecessary parts of datetime
# the code is also simpler because instead of using
    # today = datetime.datetime.today().weekday()
    # only this line is needed -> today = date.today().weekday() 


# .......today = date.today().weekday()
# this function gets the current day of the week, by returning a number between 0 to 6
# where 0 = monday, 1 = tuesday, 2 = wednesday etc.
# this implies if the number is is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 -> it is a weekday
# if the number is is 5, 6 -> it is the weekend

if date.today().weekday() < 5:
    print('Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday. ')
    # today represents the current day of the week, which has been executed above
    # the if statement checks if today is less than 5 (meaning monday to friday)
else:
    print('It is the weekend, yay! ')
    # if today is 5 or 6 the programme moves to else, the next line of code

'''
since the task only asks to list whether it is a weekday or weekend, no list or dictionary is needed
if I wanted to display the name of the day, a list or dictionary would be needed

e.g. if I was to include a list, this is what it would look like
    list of days
        days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]

    to get the number associated with each weekday
        today_num = datetime.datetime.today().weekday()

    to get corresponding name
        today_name = days[today_num]'
            if today_num < 5:
                print(f"Today is {today_name}, a weekday.")
            else:
                print(f"Today is {today_name}, a weekend.

Additonally, if the name of the current day was needed elsewhere in the programme, 
then a list/ dictionary would be needed

This is also had me wondering how exactly this programme uses a boolean
The if statement evaluates a boolean expression
today < 5 checks if the number for today (0 to 6) is less than 5
The result is either true or false
If True, it runs the first block print('Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday. ')
If False, it runs the else block print('It is the weekend, yay! ')
So, while the whole program is not a Boolean, it relies on a Boolean condition to decide what to print
